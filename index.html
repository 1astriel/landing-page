                <p class="info-text">Action RPGs have always been about two things: devastating skills and valuable items. Skills in Path of Exile are items - gems that grant abilities when socketed into equipment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="cards">
                <img class="info-img" src="./img/tree.jpg" alt="Skill tree." width="300px" height="200px">
                <p class="info-text">All of Path of Exile's character classes share its vast passive skill tree. Starting at one of seven distinct locations dictated by their chosen class, players can focus on the core specialities of their class or travel across the tree to build complex combinations of skills from various disciplines.</p>

                <img class="info-img" src="./img/itemss.jpg" alt="Items." width="300px" height="200px">
                <p class="info-text">Path of Exile is completely designed around items. Any game systems that can be itemised with random properties have been. We've gone as far as removing gold as a currency and basing our trade economy around orbs that can randomly reroll the properties of other items.</p>

                <img class="info-img" src="./img/leagues.jpg" alt="Leagues." width="300px" height="200px">
                <p class="info-text">One of the things that's most fun about playing a competitive online Action RPG is taking part in a levelling race on a fresh server. In Path of Exile, we wanted to capture this feeling without constantly resetting our main economy, so we've created a set of race leagues that are run frequently as separate game worlds with their own ladders and economies.</p>
